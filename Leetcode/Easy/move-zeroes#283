https://leetcode.com/problems/move-zeroes/

Given an integer array nums, move all 0's to the end of it while maintaining the relative order of the non-zero elements.
Note that you must do this in-place without making a copy of the array.

Input: nums = [0,1,0,3,12]
Output: [1,3,12,0,0]

class Solution {
    public void moveZeroes(int[] nums) {
        int first = 0;
        for(int i = 1;i<nums.length;i++){
            if(nums[first]==0 && nums[i]!=0 && i>first){
                int temp = nums[first];
                nums[first] = nums[i];
                nums[i] = temp;
            }
            if(nums[first]!=0)first++;
        }
    }
}

TC -O(n)
SC -O(1)

Approach :- 
we take two pointers first one will point to zeroes and other will move sequentially starting from 1 to n-1
we will swap non-zero with first pointer which is keep tracking of zeroes and increment both the pointers accordinly
