The Hamming distance between two integers is the number of positions at which the corresponding bits are different.

Given two integers x and y, return the Hamming distance between them.

Input: x = 1, y = 4
Output: 2
Explanation:
1   (0 0 0 1)
4   (0 1 0 0)

The above arrows point to positions where the corresponding bits are different.

class Solution {
    public int hammingDistance(int x, int y) {
        
        //edge case
        if(x==y) return 0;
        
        int xor = x^y;
        int count = 0;
        while(xor>0){
            xor = xor & (xor-1);
            count++;
        }
        return count;
    }
}
